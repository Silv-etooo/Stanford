Hey  
This are the assignments I have completed for Code In Place 2020.
  
Changed my entire view on how to code and think about a problem.  
Most importantly i learned to write code as I text that someone can read and understand.
It also opened my mind to how capable i am to write and create what i want using simple but basic knowledge.
